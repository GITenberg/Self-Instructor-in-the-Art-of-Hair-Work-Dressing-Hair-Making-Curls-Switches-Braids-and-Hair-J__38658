<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The necessity for a comprehensive work, giving a full and detailed
explanation of the Art of manufacturing Hair Work in all its various
branches, has been so frequently urged upon the attention of the author,
that, in compliance with an almost universal demand, he has concluded to
publish a book which will clearly illustrate the Art of Hair Dressing, and
making Hair Jewelry and Hair Work of every description. His perfect
familiarity with the business&mdash;the result of many years' successful experience&mdash;renders
him eminently competent to impart the fullest information
upon the subject of which he treats, while the great consumption and
rapidly increasing demand for every description of Hair Goods, will make
this work he now presents to the public, one of particular interest to all
classes. Heretofore the Art of making these goods has been zealously
guarded by a few dealers, who have accumulated fortunes, and would still
retain it a profound secret but for the publication of this book. This is
the only descriptive volume ever published on Hair Work. It is an
elaborate, carefully prepared book, containing over one thousand drawings,
devices and diagrams, engraved at great expense to the publisher,
and accompanied with the most comprehensive instructions. It not only
reveals to the most ordinary comprehension the hitherto concealed
mysteries of the Art, but will prove an indispensable adjunct to every
lady's toilet table, as by its aid she will not only be able to dress her own
hair in every variety of style, but make her own Hair Jewelry and articles
of Hair work, including Switches, Braids, Curls, Waterfalls, &amp;c., assisted
by a reference to plates of the most modern European and American styles.
For children, no art or accomplishment is more useful than the ability
to make articles of tasteful ornament in Hair Work. This work will open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to all such persons a path to agreeable and profitable occupation. Jewelry
Dealers, from the clear instructions herein given, can manufacture any
required pattern of Hair Jewelry, and add, without extra expense, a new
and lucrative branch to their business.</p>

<p>Persons wishing to preserve and weave into lasting mementos, the hair
of a deceased father, mother, sister, brother, or child, can also enjoy the
inexpressible advantage and satisfaction of <i>knowing</i> that the material of
their own handiwork is the actual hair of the "loved and gone."</p>

<p>No other work ever met with such an earnest demand as this treatise
upon the art of Hair Braiding. It must certainly commend itself to the
ladies of our country as invaluable. Even a hasty perusal will convince
every one of its utility and worth. Translations in French and German
are in progress.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this book of instruction, I have introduced for practice the easiest
braids first&mdash;which are chain braids. The first pattern, found on <a href="#Page_9">page 9</a>,
is a very easy and handsome one, and should be practiced to perfection
before trying any other, as it will enable the beginner to execute all others
after the first is perfected. A new beginner should be particular to place
the strands correctly upon the table, and mark the cover with precision,
after the manner shown in the diagram. I have, by the introduction of
plates, diagrams and explanatory remarks, made comprehensive and simple
the execution of all the braids herein contained. The novice should first
give special attention to preparing the hair for braiding, the adjustment of
it to the bobbins, weights, molds, &amp;c., of which plates, and full explanations
are to be found elsewhere in this book. I wish to impress upon the
mind of the worker, that every change made with the strands changes the
numbers of them to correspond with the numbers on the table. For
example: lift No. 1 over No. 2, which would make No. 1 No. 2, and No.
2 No. 1, &amp;c.</p>

hairs in a strand, and place
on table like pattern. Commence
at A, take Nos. 1,&mdash;one in each
hand&mdash;lift them over the table, one
on each side of the mold, and lay
them between Nos. 1 at B, and
bring back the Nos. 2 from B, one
on each side of the mold, and lay
them between Nos. 2 at A; then go
to C, lift Nos. 1 over between Nos.
1 at D, passing one strand each side of the mold, and bring
back Nos. 2 from D, and lay between Nos. 2 at C. Then you are
through the braid, ready to commence at A, as at first, and repeat
until finished.</div>



<p>Braid this over a mold, made of small wire, with a hole in one
end like the eye of a needle, so as to draw a small cord in the place
of the wire. When you have it braided, take off the weights, tie
the ends fast on the wire, and push the braid tight together; then
boil in water about ten minutes, and take it out and put in an oven
as hot as it will bear without burning, until quite dry; then slip it
off the wire on to the cord, sew the ends of the braid so it will not
slip, and put a little shellac on the end to keep it fast. If you
want it elastic, use elastic cord. To vary the size of the braid,
vary the number of hairs in a strand.</p>

with sixty hairs in a strand. Take
Nos. 2, lift over table to B, lay them
in between Nos. 1 at B, and bring

Nos. 1 at A. Then walk
around table to C; take Nos. 1 <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and and'">and</ins>
lift over table and lay them in
between Nos. 1 at D, and bring
back Nos. 1 from D to C; then take
Nos. 2 at C, lift over table and lay them inside of Nos. 2 at D, and
bring back Nos. 2 from D to C. After braiding several times
round to suit your taste, say five, reverse the braid by commencing
at C, and braiding as you did at A, by taking Nos. 2 at C, lift
over table to D, and lay them in between Nos. 1 at D, and bring
back Nos. 2 from D, and lay in between Nos. 1 at C. Then go to
A and take Nos. 1, lift over table and lay in between Nos. 1 at B,
and bring back Nos. 1 from B to A, then take Nos. 2 at A, lift
over table and lay in between Nos. 2 at B, and fetch back Nos. 2
from B to A, then commence at C again and braid five times.
Then commence at A as you did at first, reversing it every time
you braid it five times through. Braid it over a small wire, tie the
ends on the wire, boil and dry the same as chain on page nine,
only you need not press the braid together on the wire.</p>

hairs in a strand, or any number that
can be divided by four, and sixty
strands for usual size, and place
them on table like pattern. Have
every alternate two strands of black
hair, and the others of light hair.
Commence at A, taking two strands
of light hair in left hand, Nos. 1 and
2, and take two strands of black
hair in right hand, Nos. 3 and 4,
and cross No. 2 (light) over No. 3 (dark), then No. 1 (light) under
No. 3 (dark), then No. 4 (dark) over Nos. 1 and 2 (light); so on
around the table to the right until you get to A; then commence
and work back to the left by taking light hair in left hand and
dark hair in right hand, as before, and put No. 3 (dark) over No.
2 (light), and No. 4 (dark) under No. 2 (light), and No. 1 (light)
over Nos. 3 and 4 (dark), so on around the table till you get to A;
then commence as at first, so on, braiding first one way around the
table then the other till you have the chain completed.</p>


<p>Braid it over wood, or brass wire, the size and length you wish
your chain. When braided take off your weights, tie the ends fast
and boil and dry, then take out the mold and put a cord through
with some cotton wrapped around it so it will be soft and pliable.
This is called the <span class="smcap">Striped Snake Braid</span>, and can be braided all

<p>The hair to be used in braiding should be combed perfectly straight,
and tied with a string at the roots, to prevent wasting. Then count the
number of hairs for a strand, and pull it out from the tips, dip it in water
and draw it between the thumb and finger to make it lie smoothly; then
tie a solid, single knot at one end, the same as you would with a sewing
thread.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE BOBBIN.</div>

<p>To prepare the bobbin for the hair, wind it with white thread, as
shown in the plate, and fasten it with a slip-knot over the knob, leaving
an end of some three inches, with a solid knot tied at the end of it. To
adjust the hair to the bobbins, take the prepared strands of hair and tie
the knotted ends in a square knot to the ends of the strings on the bobbins.
When each strand is thus prepared and tied to the bobbin strings, place
them even, and tie the ends with a string to prevent their slipping.</p>

<p>See cut of <a href="#bobbins">Bobbins</a> on another page.</p>


<div class='center'><br />HOW TO PLACE THEM ON THE TABLE-COVER FOR BRAIDING.</div>

through the center of cover; then tie the mold or form to be braided,
around in the center, and you are ready for braiding.</p>

The No. 1 size is used for braiding Rings and Chains, that have

for braiding Chains that have from forty to one hundred hairs in a
strand. Either size will answer for any pattern of Chain or Ring,
but to vary the size of the Bobbin according to the number of hairs
in a strand, gives it a nicer finish. To prepare the Bobbin, wind
it with thread, as shown in the cut, leaving the thread some three
inches long, with a solid knot tied at the end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The above cuts represent the completed Bracelet Braid. The
No. 1 is formed from fourteen small braids, braided according to
diagram and explanation on page <a href="#Page_104">104</a>,&mdash;using, however, but thirty-two
strands, instead of eighty.</p>

<p>After you have the small braids all completed and prepared, as
required in the explanation, sew them together at one end, so they
all lie smooth and flat, then divide them off in twos, using each two
as one strand, and plait them together; commence at the right side,
take one strand at a time, and lift over one and under two till you
get to the center, then commence on the left side and braid the same
way, and so on till finished. Then sew the ends well, trim them,
and put on a little shellac to fasten them in the clasps.</p>

<p>No. 2 is from the same pattern, and is prepared and finished up
in the same manner. For this Bracelet you use fifteen small
braids, divide them into threes for each strand, and lift over one
and under one, from each side to the center.</p>

<p>The following Lithographic designs of Hair Jewelry, Flowers
and Pictures, are given for the purpose of showing a few of the
many beautiful forms into which the human hair may be transposed.
Each and every one of the devices on the following pages, with the
exception of the flowers and pictures, can be braided from the
diagrams and explanations given in the first one hundred and
twenty pages of this book. Select any article you may wish to
make, and by referring to the patterns, you can easily find the
style and directions whereby to braid it. We might have given
twice the number of patterns, or even more, but any person can,
after a little experience, readily invent new and different styles of
braids, and by so doing, each can satisfy their own peculiar taste.</p>

<p>The making of Hair Flowers is very simple, and yet, of course,
every one has first to learn it. Supply yourself with as many
different colors of hair as you can, and by applying Gum Tragacanth,
it renders it capable of being cut in any shape you may wish&mdash;such
as leaves, twigs, buds, &amp;c., and by judiciously arranging
the colors, the effect will be very pleasing. Pictures are made in
the same manner, and any one possessing the least artistic skill,
can make any flower or picture they may desire, and many pleasing
adornments and lasting mementos may thereby be had.</p>

<p>All articles intended to be worn as jewelry, should, of course, be
mounted with gold, and as this kind of work is not done in all
jewelry establishments, I wish to say that my facilities for this
branch of business is complete, and the work done is in the best
possible manner. I can guarantee satisfaction in all cases, let the
style desired be what it may. In sending braids to be mounted,
draw on paper, as near as can be, the style or design you want.</p>

<span class="caption">WEAVING HAIR FOR SWITCHES.</span>
</div>


<p>The above cut represents the apparatus used for weaving hair
into Switches, Curls, Wigs, &amp;c. It is a very simple arrangement,
and can be easily constructed. Provide two straight sticks, about
twelve inches long, and in one of them bore three small holes, two
inches apart, in which to place as many thumb-screws, to be used
for tightening or loosening the cords; in the other, have a single
wooden pin or nail, to fasten the cords to. Place the sticks in a
firm, upright position, about three feet apart, either by boring holes
through a table, or by using mortised blocks, such as is plainly
shown in cut, at the right end. After placing them in position, put
on three cords, as shown in diagram, numbered 1, 2 and 3. For
this weft use linen thread, at Nos. 1, 2 and 3.</p>

<p>In commencing to weave, place the hair between two cards, as
shown in diagram, and draw out with the right hand, between the
thumb and fore-finger, the quantity of hair required for the size of
the weft; then change it into the left hand, and place it up to the
threads, Nos. 1, 2 and 3, as shown in diagram; lay the strand over
No. 1, under No. 2, over No. 3, around under No. 3, over Nos. 2
and 1, around under Nos. 1 and 2, over No. 3, around under Nos.
3 and 2, and over No. 1. Then push the strands together, as in cut.</p>

<p>The No. 1 of the above cuts represents the winding and sewing
of the switch after it is woven. For sewing a switch on points, after
weaving, take Berlin cord, about one-sixteenth of an inch thick,
and tie a solid knot at the end, and sew the end of the weft to the
knotted end of the cord; then wind the weft around the cord, as
shown in cut, the length of point desired, turning the end of the
cord over to form a loop. Cut the weft according to the number
of points desired in the switch. Cut No. 2 shows the switch all
complete.</p>

<p>In commencing to weave, place the hair between two cards, or
stiff brushes, as shown in diagram, pressing them tight together, so
that in drawing out, it is perfectly free from tangles; draw out
with the right hand, between the thumb and fore-finger, the
quantity of hair required for the size of the weft; then change it
into the left hand, and lift it up to the No. 1 cord, as shown in
diagram; lay the strand over No. 1, under No. 2, over No. 3,
around under No. 3, over Nos. 2 and 1, around under Nos. 1 and
2, over No. 3, around under No. 3, over No. 2, and under No. 1.
Then push the strands together, as shown in diagram. For this
weft use fine, strong linen thread.</p>

</div>


<p>After weaving, according to directions on page <a href="#Page_241">241</a>, take a piece
of ribbon an inch wide, the same color of hair, and as long as you
wish the curls to be in width, and sew the weft to it back and forth.
After that is done, pipe them, which is done in this manner:
Dampen the hair, comb each curl out straight, and wind it tightly
on a rattan stick about four inches long, having each curl on a
separate stick, and commencing to wind at the tip end, tying them
firmly to keep in place. Then boil in water for thirty minutes, and
place in an oven as hot as they will bear without burning, until
quite dry. When dry and perfectly cool, take them off the sticks,
and smooth over a curling iron, the size you wish the curls. Side
curls and frizzes should be prepared the same way.</p>

<p>Cut No. 2 represents a set of Curls and Puffs. For explanation
of Puffs, see page <a href="#Page_245">245</a>.</p>

<p>In making a Chignon, you have first to make the cushion.
Take the combings or waste hair, which is of no other use, and
place it between the cards or stiff brushes, the same as for weaving.
Use the weaving apparatus, with two piping cords, instead of three
small ones, and wind the hair all up, by passing over, between and
under the cords. Boil and dry it, and then pull out the cord,
which leaves it all crimped, ready to weave, according to directions
on page <a href="#Page_239">239</a>. Then sew it on a cord, the same as a switch, and
form it in any shape you desire, for a Waterfall, Bow or Puffs.
This completes the cushion. Then weave the long hair for the
covering, according to directions on page <a href="#Page_243">243</a>, and sew it to the
top end of the cushion; comb it out smooth, cover the cushion, and
tie a cord around it immediately at the bottom; then bring up the
end of the hair, and pin it to the inside. Cut No. 1 is intended to
represent the cushion, and No. 2 the complete Waterfall.</p>

<p>Cut No. 3 represents the Bow, which is made in the same
manner, by using two small cushions, like cut No. 1, and placing
between them a strand of smooth or braided hair.</p>

</div>



<p>To make Puffs for front of head, from false hair, similar to cut
No. 1, weave hair from eight to twelve inches long, according to
directions on page <a href="#Page_241">241</a>; then take a ribbon, about one and a half
inches wide, any length required, and tack it on a wig block, or
straight piece of board, and sew the weft crossways a quarter of an
inch apart, till the ribbon is entirely covered; then divide it off in
as many puffs as desired, comb each out straight, and wind it over
the two fore-fingers, close up to ribbon, and put in a hair-pin to
retain it.</p>

<p>To make Puffs for back of head, cut No. 2, prepare the same way;
make the foundation the shape and size you wish the puffs, and sew
it on the same way you want the puffs to run. The puffs may be
made over a cushion, formed of crimped hair the shape wanted, and
wound over that instead of the fingers. Ladies not wearing false
hair, can have her own hair dressed by following the above
directions.</p>

<p>Cut No. 3 represents a coil, which is made from a switch, and
wound over a long roll of crimped hair. They are much nicer, but
more expensive, by being made altogether from a switch, as that
can be twisted into a rope or braided, before coiling.</p>

<p>I herewith present, on the following pages, a number of
engravings <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'llustrative'">illustrative</ins> of a few of the many styles of Hair
Dressing, accompanied with explanatory remarks as to their
execution. They are the latest and most fashionable European
and American styles, and will prove indispensable to every lady's
toilet, as, from the explanations, they will be able, with very
little practice, to dress their own hair in any desired style; and
when any new style is inaugurated, after studying and practicing
the directions given with each illustration, she will find it an easy
matter to arrange it accordingly.</p>

<p>Any one learning Hair Dressing, should acquire perfectly the
execution of the first pattern&mdash;the Promenade Head-Dress&mdash;as
that is very easily arranged, and when you have once executed
it in a perfect manner, the others will prove comparatively easy.</p>

<p>The manner of dressing the hair at the present day calls for
much attention, and many inquiries are addressed us on the
subject. It is plain, however, that what would correspond with
the complexion and physiognomy of one, would certainly have a
distasteful appearance on another; consequently, in answering
inquiries, I can do nothing more than give the different
styles worn. Before giving my illustrations on Hair Dressing,
I have given instructions how to weave hair for chignons,
curls, switches, &amp;c., and how to put them in shape, and with
the directions given with each illustration on Hair Dressing, it
will certainly be an easy task to arrange the hair in any style
that is now or may be in fashion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

forming a diadem, turning the ends under; then comb the hair
from temples over the braids, and put back under the Chignon, and
fasten. Place a net of pearl or gilt beads over the Chignon, as in

<p>In placing before the public the only book ever published in the
"Art of Hair Work," it is but due to the purchasers of it to say
something in relation to the trade in Human Hair. It is not my
intention, however, to enter into an extended detail and complete
history, but simply give a few items that will serve to show what
enormous strides have been taken within the last few years in this
branch of business. It is a business that but few know anything
about&mdash;at least in this country, for it is comparatively new here&mdash;but
it is one that is very rapidly increasing, and is now almost
doubling itself each year.</p>

<p>The larger quantity, in fact nearly the whole amount of hair
retailed in this country is imported from Europe, where the dealing
in human hair has been made an established and legitimate business
for years, and a great deal of attention is paid in purchasing and
preparing it for the market. Paris is the greatest market for the
sale of human hair in the world; but the amount of superfluous
hair used and worn throughout all Europe, could we give the
figures, would seem incredible. The amount imported to the
United States in the years of 1859 and 1860 was not far from
150,000 and 200,000 pounds, which was valued at that time at
from $800,000 to $1,000,000. Since that time it has been steadily
increasing, and the amount imported last year may be set down at
three times as much as during the years above mentioned. Paris
also finds as great a sale for the article in Russia as in America&mdash;the
shipments to each being about equal. Thus, it will be seen,
that if all the hair reserved in Europe for the home demand were
added to that which is imported, the amount would be almost
beyond conception; and yet, but about one-tenth part of the whole
production ever leaves its native country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>It is mostly procured from the markets of France, Italy, Russia
and Germany, and large quantities are obtained from Norway and
Sweden.</p>

<p>The Norwegians were among the first to make ornaments of hair
to be worn as jewelry, but, in a great measure, we are indebted to
the French for the perfection to which the art has attained. Of
the different varieties of hair, that which is obtained in France and
Italy is by far the best, being of a much finer texture, even color,
and of a more glossy appearance than that from other countries.</p>

<p>The principal requirement in hair to make it valuable is length,
and after it is thrown upon the market it is all assorted&mdash;the long
from the short&mdash;which is a task of extreme difficulty.</p>

<p>The prices of hair range all the way from $15 to $200 per pound,
(a wide range, but certainly not too large,) and is rated according
to hue, length and texture. The smallest price paid is for the
short, coarse hair of the poorest quality, and which can be used
only for certain purposes. Hair of the ordinary colors range in
price from $15 to $100 per pound, but that of gray and white
from $100 to $200 per pound, and even then is not considered
exorbitant. In fact, hair is worth any and all prices. We
know of one dealer who had in his possession a very small
quantity, weighing but a half pound and measuring seventy
inches, for which he was offered <i>four hundred dollars!</i> and, strange
as it may appear, he refused to accept it. White hair is mostly
obtained by being picked from the gray, and it not unfrequently
happens that many hundred pounds have to be assorted before being
able to secure one single pound of pure white. It is mainly used
in the manufacture of wigs, and it frequently puzzles the dealer
to prepare one for a customer that will exactly match, and this,
with the scarcity of the article, cause the extraordinary price.</p>

<p>Hair is shipped in both a prepared and unprepared state. That
which is prepared undergoes a process of washing, scouring and
cleansing, which leaves it in the nicest possible state; all the oil,
dirt and other unhealthy substances are completely separated from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
it, leaving it perfectly free from all unhealthy influences. That
which is shipped in an unprepared, or raw state, is subjected to the
same process of cleansing after its arrival, and it is so thorough
that it is altogether impossible for anything except the hair to
remain. It has frequently been examined with a microscope,
which has proved in every case how successful the cleansing process
had been, for it revealed nothing whatever of a foreign nature,
and, in fact, after its extraordinary cleaning it would be simply
impossible.</p>

<p>After being fully prepared it is then made into switches, curls,
plaits, fronts, wigs, chignons, and not a small amount is used in the
manufacture of hair jewelry, and such other articles as are worn
for ornaments. The jewelry manufactured at this time is as durable
as the all gold jewelry, and is done in a style of surpassing neatness,
thus rendering it beautiful, either as an ornament or memento.
There are but very few places in the United States where hair
jewelry is made, and as it is comparatively a new business, but few
have learned it. It is surprising, however, to notice the many
beautiful patterns and elegant designs into which it is transformed.
There is nothing in the way of jewelry or ornament of any description
but what is or may be made from human hair; and, after being
gold-mounted, the contrast between them makes the hair jewelry
preferable to the all gold.</p>

<p>There are many strange incidents related of the human hair
suddenly changing its color&mdash;many of which it is hard to believe&mdash;and
the causes assigned are various. We are told of persons who,
from excessive grief, found their hair had gradually changed from
a dark brown to an almost perfect white; others, from the same
cause, in the short space of one week discovered their hair plentifully
streaked with grey, giving them the appearance, although
young, of being quite old. Many have had their hair change on
account of extreme fright, but we have now to give the first instance
we have ever heard of its turning from white to that of any other
color, except by the aid of dyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>A Parisian, M. Stanislaus Martin, has published in the <i>Bulletin
de Therapeutique</i> the curious case of a worker in metals who had
wrought in copper only five months, and whose hair, which was
lately white, is now of so decided a <i>green</i> that the man cannot
appear in the street without immediately becoming the object of
general curiosity. He is perfectly well, his hair alone being
affected by the copper, notwithstanding the precautions taken by
him to protect it from the action of the metal. Chemical analysis
shows that his hair contains a notable quantity of acetate of copper,
and that it is to this circumstance that it owes its beautiful
green color, which is most singular and remarkable.</p>

<p>The practice of wearing false hair, although it was not generally
dealt in as traffic, has been in vogue many hundred years. The
Greek and Roman ladies were, in olden times, as active in their
toilet for the head as the fashionable ladies of the present day, and
false hair was always brought into requisition, which was then
obtained from the Germans, and they in turn from their slaves.</p>

<p>Powdering the hair, which is now the rage in all fashionable
circles, is also an ancient practice, and was as much indulged in by
the men as the women. History tells us that the consumption of
hair powder by the soldiers of George II was enormous. It was
calculated, that inasmuch as the military force of England and the
colonies was, including cavalry, infantry, militia and fensibles,
250,000, each man used a pound of flour a week, simply for powdering
their hair. The quantity consumed in this way was 6,500
tons per annum; an amount sufficient to sustain 30,000 persons on
bread. Gold and silver hair powder was also plentifully used, and
at a time much earlier in the world's history, than is generally
supposed. Josephus relates that Solomon's horse-guards daily
strewed their heads with gold-dust, which glittered in the sun;
and there are similar instances of different personages recorded in
the bible.</p>

<p>The human hair seems to have been given us both for an
ornament and covering&mdash;being susceptible of transformation in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
almost any desired shape, and apparently indispensable for covering
and protecting the head. The ancient Greeks were very partial to
long hair, considering it by far the more becoming; but the
Egyptians regarded it as an incumbrance, shaved their heads, and
substituted wigs. The ancients, generally speaking, strangely
considered a fine head of hair so desirable, that it became sacred.
They frequently dedicated it to the gods, on important occasions
of marriage, victory, escape from death and danger, and the
burial of friends. Different styles of wearing the hair, was
resorted to for denoting the various grades, or positions in life, of
the people, some wearing it quite long, others short, and some
dressing it in a peculiar manner,&mdash;each style, or length, being
according to the condition, wealth, or social standing of the wearer.
Plucking it out, or neglecting it, was a token of affliction.</p>

<p>Hair contains a very small quantity of water, manganese, iron,
and various salts of lime, which have been found by the various
methods of analyzation, and it is owing to these properties that it
is peculiarly indestructible. It has been found on mummies, more
than twenty centuries old, in a perfect and unaltered state, and
many instances are related, which are now admitted to be facts,
of the hair continuing to grow, for a time, after death.</p>

<p>There has never before been a book written and published, that
was particularly dedicated to the subject of Hair, and as the field
is a vast one, both as regards the importance of the subject, and
the information to be gained thereby, it is simply strange that no
one has ever entered it. It has been too long neglected, and the
increasing necessity for a treatise of this kind, has been pressed
upon the attention of the author, and induced the publication
of this work, which will certainly meet the necessities of the age.</p>

<p>There is much else that might be said on this subject that would
prove both interesting and instructive, but we prefer for the present
to let it rest. We have endeavored in preparing this book both to
instruct and amuse; for, by following its instructions, it may be
made to be profitable and highly remunerative, and in making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
articles, either for gifts, mementoes, or otherwise, it will certainly
be amusing and entertaining. We have given the instructions in a
way that all may readily understand, and as the patterns are
numerous, and the designs elegant, we think there can be nothing
lacking to make the book all it claims to be.</p>

<p>The principal offices for the sale of these books, will be at my
establishments, No. 737 Broadway, New York, and No. 81 South
Clark Street, Chicago.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
